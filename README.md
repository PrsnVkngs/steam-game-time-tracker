# steam-game-time-tracker
this code is made to allow the user to sum up all the time that they have spent in game on steam.

All you have to do is provide the program with a .txt file from the HTML code from your steam community page.

1.  Navigate to:  https://steamcommunity.com/id/<your steam id here>/games/?tab=all
2.  Right click and select "Save As..."
3.  Give the file any name you want. Save it as "Webpage, Complete (.html)"
4.  If you are on windows, you must enable the "Show file extensions" feature and rename the download file such that you have
"download.txt" instead of "download.html"
5.  Provide the program with the absolute file location. For example: "C:\\Users\\<your name>\\Downloads\\steamgame.txt"
For step 5, Windows users must use "\\" double back slashes, Mac and Linux users "\" or "/" is enough.
6.  Execute the program. It will display the game time for each game and total time for each. 

This is version 0.1 for the project, and the steps above are valid for this version. v0.1 only includes the source code, and you will need to compile and execute yourself. Future versions will include an easy to use GUI.
